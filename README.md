# Monte Carlo simulation of sodium incorporation in ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O in the lower mantle under high pressure conditions

Description: Ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O is the second most abundant mineral in the Earth's lower mantle. Sodium (Na1+) can incorporate inside the structure through different mechanisms at high pressures conditions (23-136 GPa). This project will focus on studying how pressure affects the propabiblity and energetics of sodium incorporation in (Mg,Fe)O. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating lattice compression effects are going to be used to analyze site prefences during the substitution (Mg vs Fe) and solubility trends at different pressures. 

Objectives:

1. Implement a Monte Carlo simulation to model sodium substitution in ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O
2. Investigate the effect of pressure on incorporation energies and site preferences (Mg vs Fe)
3. Explore how increasing pressure changes Na solubility trends
